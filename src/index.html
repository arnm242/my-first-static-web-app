    <h6>The Air Jordan 1 made its debut in 1984. Michael Jordan first wore these iconic sneakers during his 11th NBA game where he played
        vs the Philadelphia 76ers. It wasn't until 1985, though, that the shoe was released for sales at the retail price of $65. This specific
        silhouette was designed by Peter Moore.</h6>
